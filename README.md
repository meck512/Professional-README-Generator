## Description
This is a README.md generator, so after completing a project instead of manually creating the markdown file & format this application will prompt users for project information based on best practices. The application will then fully generate a custom README.md file using a markdown template and user input.

This was my first time as a developer using Node.js, and I am happy with how it turned out. I only hit one small challenge, which was trying to add custom license badges for each of the licensing options. I tried a couple different methods and after some collaboration decided to input a basic badge and input the license text instead of the customized badges. In the future, my goal is to update the markdown template to make it pop more & I’d like to implement more badges wherever relevant. Overall, I hope you enjoy this app, thanks for checking it out!
